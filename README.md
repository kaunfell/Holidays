# Holidays Calculator


### About
No AI tools used.

Everything started from here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-calculate-days-left-until-next-christmas-using-javascript/
and I continued to just build and read other devs' problems in spesific areas and
modified them usable for my project 

Thinking and solution process:
- I was thinking how to add other days and store all in a nice way (--> object)
- How to get the data from the object tree in a clean way
- How to add styles without having multiple css files (--> css variables and themes, changing the themes with only one line in JS)
